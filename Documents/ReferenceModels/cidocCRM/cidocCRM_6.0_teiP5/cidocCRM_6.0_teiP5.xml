                <p>This version of the #cidocCRM Definition was generated by a simple conversion 
                    of the official Microsoft Word document to TEI P5 using the OxGarage
                    on-line conversion processor. The resulting huge single-line XML file was
                    then reformatted and saved using oXygenXML Editor with the addition of this 
                    statement.
                </p>
                <p>Conversion of the #cidocCRM Definition from MS-Word to TEI P5 is undertaken
                    by Jim Salmons on behalf of the FactMiners.org Citizen Science/History project
                    as a valuable TEI learning experience and to facilitate our #cidocCRMgraph and
                    #cidocCRMdev activites.

                        CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (“CRM”), </hi>a formal ontology intended to
                    facilitate the integration, mediation and interchange of heterogeneous cultural
                    heritage information. The CRM is the culmination of more than a decade of
                    standards development work by the International Committee for Documentation
                    (CIDOC) of the International Council of Museums (ICOM). Work on the CRM itself
                    began in 1996 under the auspices of the ICOM-CIDOC Documentation Standards
                    Working Group. Since 2000, development of the CRM has been officially delegated
                    by ICOM-CIDOC to the CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group, which collaborates with
                    the ISO working group ISO/TC46/SC4/WG9 to bring the CRM to the form and status
                    of an International Standard.</p>

                <p>The primary role of the CRM is to enable information exchange and integration
                    between heterogeneous sources of cultural heritage information. It aims at
                    providing the semantic definitions and clarifications needed to transform
                    disparate, localised information sources into a coherent global resource, be it
                    within a larger institution, in intranets or on the Internet. </p>
                <p>Its perspective is supra-institutional and abstracted from any specific local
                    context. This goal determines the constructs and level of detail of the CRM. </p>
                <p rend="justify">More specifically, it defines and is restricted to the <hi
                        rend="bold">underlying semantics</hi> of database schemata and document <hi
                        rend="bold">structures</hi> used in cultural heritage and museum
                    documentation in terms of a formal ontology. It does <hi rend="bold">not</hi>
                    define any of the <hi rend="bold">terminology</hi> appearing typically as data
                    in the respective data structures; however it foresees the characteristic
                    relationships for its use. It does <hi rend="bold">not</hi> aim at proposing
                    what cultural institutions <hi rend="bold">should</hi> document. Rather it
                    explains the logic of what they actually currently document, and thereby enables
                        <hi rend="bold">semantic interoperability.</hi></p>
                <p>It intends to provide a model of the intellectual structure of cultural
                    documentation in logical terms. As such, it is not optimised for
                    implementation-specific storage and processing aspects. Implementations may lead
                    to solutions where elements and links between relevant elements of our
                    conceptualizations are no longer explicit in a database or other structured
                    storage system. For instance the birth event that connects elements such as
                    father, mother, birth date, birth place may not appear in the database, in order
                    to save storage space or response time of the system. The CRM allows us to
                    explain how such apparently disparate entities are intellectually
                    interconnected, and how the ability of the database to answer certain
                    intellectual questions is affected by the omission of such elements and
                    links.</p>
                <p rend="justify">The CRM aims to support the following specific
                    functionalities:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Inform developers of information systems as a guide to good practice in
                        conceptual modelling, in order to effectively structure and relate
                        information assets of cultural documentation. </item>
                    <item>Serve as a common language for domain experts and IT developers to
                        formulate requirements and to agree on system functionalities with respect
                        to the correct handling of cultural contents.</item>
                    <item>To serve as a formal language for the identification of common information
                        contents in different data formats; in particular to support the
                        implementation of automatic data transformation algorithms from local to
                        global data structures without loss of meaning. The latter being useful for
                        data exchange, data migration from legacy systems, data information
                        integration and mediation of heterogeneous sources.</item>
                    <item>To support associative queries against integrated resources by providing a
                        global model of the basic classes and their associations to formulate such
                        queries.</item>
                    <item>It is further believed, that advanced natural language algorithms and
                        case-specific heuristics can take significant advantage of the CRM to
                        resolve free text information into a formal logical form, if that is
                        regarded beneficial. The CRM is however not thought to be a means to replace
                        scholarly text, rich in meaning, by logical forms, but only a means to
                        identify related data. </item>
                </list>
                <p rend="justify">Users of the CRM should be aware that the definition of data entry
                    systems requires support of community-specific terminology, guidance to what
                    should be documented and in which sequence, and application-specific consistency
                    controls. The CRM does not provide such notions.</p>
                <p>By its very structure and formalism, the CRM is extensible and users are
                    encouraged to create extensions for the needs of more specialized communities
                    and applications.</p>

                <p rend="justify">However, a more detailed and useful definition can be articulated
                    by defining both the Intended Scope, a broad and maximally-inclusive definition
                    of general application principles, and the Practical Scope, which is expressed
                    by the overall scope of a reference set of specific identifiable museum
                    documentation standards and practices that the CRM aims to encompass, however
                    restricted in its details to the limitations of the Intended Scope.</p>

                    required for the exchange and integration of heterogeneous scientific
                    documentation of museum collections. This definition requires further

                        mean that information intended for presentation to members of the general
                        public is excluded, but rather that the CRM is intended to provide the level
                        of detail and precision expected and required by museum professionals and

                    <p>The goal of the CRM is to enable the integration of the largest number of
                        information resources. Therefore it aims to provide the greatest flexibility
                        of systems to become compatible, rather than imposing one particular
                        solution. </p>
                    <p rend="justify">Users intending to take advantage of the semantic
                        interoperability offered by the CRM may want to make parts of their data
                        structures compatible with the CRM. Compatibility may pertain either to the
                        associations by which users would like their data to be accessible in an
                        integrated environment, or to the contents intended for transport to other
                        environments, allowing encoded meaning to be preserved in a target
                        system.</p>
                    <p rend="justify">The CRM does not require complete matching of all user
                        documentation structures with the CRM, nor that systems should always
                        implement all CRM concepts and associations; instead it leaves room both for
                        extensions, needed to capture the full richness of cultural information, and
                        for simplifications, required for reasons of economy.</p>
                    <p rend="justify">Furthermore, the CRM provides a means of interpreting
                        structured information so that large amounts of data can be transformed or
                        mediated automatically. It does not require unstructured or semi-structured
                        free text information to be analysed into a formal logical representation.
                        In other words, it does not aim to provide more structure than users have
                        previously provided. The interpretation of information in the form of free
                        text falls outside the scope of compatibility considerations. The CRM does,
                        however, allow free text information to be integrated with structured
                        information.</p>

                        concepts are used to classify items of discourse and their relationships. By
                        virtue of this classification, data can be understood as propositions of a
                        kind declared by the CRM about real world facts, such as “Object x. forms
                        part of: Object y”. In case the encoding, i.e. the language used to describe
                        a fact, is changed, only an expert conversant with both languages can assess
                        if the two propositions do indeed describe the same fact. If this is the
                        case, then there is no loss of meaning with respect to CRM concepts.
                        Communities of practice requiring fewer concepts than the CRM declares may
                        restrict CRM compatibility with respect to an explicitly declared subset of
                        the CRM.</p>

                        detailed and specialized than the CRM or whose scope extends beyond that of
                        the CRM. In such cases, the standard guarantees only the preservation of
                        meaning with respect to CRM concepts. However, additional information that
                        can be regarded as extending CRM concepts may be communicated and preserved
                        in CRM compatible systems through the appropriate use of controlled
                        terminology. The specification of the latter techniques does not fall under
                        the scope of this standard. Communities of practice requiring extensions to
                        the CRM are encouraged to declare their extensions as CRM-compatible

                    <p>Any CRM-compatible form is automatically import-compatible with the CRM. Note
                        that an import-compatible data structure may be semantically richer than the
                        CRM. It may contain elements that, through the use of a transformation
                        algorithm, can be made to correspond to CRM concepts or specializations
                        thereof or that contain elements with meanings that fall outside the scope

                                        that belongs to a class is called an <hi rend="bold"
                                            >instance</hi> of this class. A class is associated with
                                        an open set of real life instances, known as the <hi
                                            rend="bold">extension</hi> of the class. Here “open” is
                                        used in the sense that it is generally beyond our
                                        capabilities to know all instances of a class in the world
                                        and indeed that the future may bring new instances about at
                                        any time (<hi rend="bold">Open World</hi>). Therefore a
                                        class cannot be defined by enumerating its instances. A
                                        class plays a role analogous to a grammatical noun, and can
                                        be completely defined without reference to any other
                                        construct (unlike properties<hi rend="bold">,</hi> which
                                        must have an unambiguously defined domain and range). In

                                        are used synonymously with class. </p><p>For example: </p><p

                                        For instance, some systems may declare that elephants are
                                        grey, and regard a white elephant as an exception. Under
                                        strict inheritance it would hold that: if all elephants were
                                        grey, then a white elephant could not be an elephant.
                                        Obviously not all elephants are grey. To be grey is not part

                                <cell>Multiple <hi rend="bold">Instantiation</hi> is the term that
                                    describes the case that an instance of class A is also regarded
                                    as an instance of one or more other classes B1...n at the same
                                    time. When multiple instantiation is used, it has the effect
                                    that the properties of all these classes become available to
                                    describe this instance. For instance, some particular cases of
                                    destruction may also be activities (e.g.,Herostratos’ deed), but
                                    not all destructions are activities (e.g., destruction of
                                    Herculaneum). In comparison, multiple inheritance describes the
                                    case that all instances of a class A are implicitly instances of
                                    all superclasses of A, by virtue of the definition of the class
                                    A, whereas the combination of classes used for multiple
                                    instantiation is a characteristic of particular instances only.
                                    It is important to note that multiple instantiation is not
                                    allowed using combinations of disjoint classes.</cell>

                                        their behaviour in time. Endurants are wholly present (i.e.,
                                        all their proper parts are present) at any time they are
                                        present. Perdurants, on the other hand, just extend in time
                                        by accumulating different temporal parts, so that, at any
                                        time they are present, they are only partially present, in
                                        the sense that some of their proper temporal parts (e.g.,
                                        their previous or future phases) may be not present. E.g.,
                                        the piece of paper you are reading now is wholly present,
                                        while some temporal parts of your reading are not present
                                        any more. Philosophers say that endurants are entities that
                                        are in time, while lacking however temporal parts (so to
                                        speak, all their parts flow with them in time). Perdurants,
                                        on the other hand, are entities that happen in time, and can
                                        have temporal parts (all their parts are fixed in time).”

                                        interoperability, data from both tables may only be

                        <p>The CRM defines some dependencies between properties and the classes that
                            are their domains or ranges. These can be one or both of the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>A) the property is necessary for the domain </p>
                        <p>B) the property is necessary for the range, or, in other words, the range
                            is dependent on the property.</p>
                        <p>The possible kinds of dependencies are defined in the table above. Note
                            that if a dependent property is not specified for an instance of the
                            respective domain or range, it means that the property exists, but the
                            value on one side of the property is unknown. In the case of optional
                            properties, the methodology proposed by the CRM does not distinguish
                            between a value being unknown or the property not being applicable at
                            all. For example, one may know that an object has an owner, but the
                            owner is unknown. In a CRM instance this case cannot be distinguished
                            from the fact that the object has no owner at all. Of course, such
                            details can always be specified by a textual note. </p>

                        <list type="unordered">
                            <item>Classes are identified by numbers preceded by the letter “E”
                                (historically classes were sometimes referred to as “Entities”), and
                                are named using noun phrases (nominal groups) using title case
                                (initial capitals). For example, E63 Beginning of Existence. </item>
                            <item>Properties are identified by numbers preceded by the letter “P,”
                                and are named in both directions using verbal phrases in lower case.
                                Properties with the character of states are named in the present
                                tense, such as “has type”, whereas properties related to events are
                                named in past tense, such as “carried out.” For example, <hi
                                    rend="italic">P126 employed (was employed in)</hi>.</item>
                            <item>Property names should be read in their non-parenthetical form for
                                the domain-to-range direction, and in parenthetical form for the
                                range-to-domain direction. Reading a property in range-to-domain
                                direction is equivalent to the inverse of that property. Following a
                                current notational practice in OWL knowledge representation
                                language, we represent inverse properties in this text by adding a
                                letter “i” following the identification number and the parenthetical
                                form of the full property name, such as <hi rend="italic">P59i is
                                    located on or within</hi>, which is the inverse of <hi
                                    rend="italic">P59 has section (is located on or
                                within).</hi></item>
                            <item>Properties with a range that is a subclass of E59 Primitive Value
                                (such as <hi rend="italic">E1 CRM Entity. P3 has note: E62
                                    String</hi>, for example) have no parenthetical name form,
                                because reading the property name in the range-to-domain direction
                                is not regarded as meaningful.</item>
                            <item>Properties that have identical domain and range are either
                                symmetric or transitive. Instantiating a symmetric property implies
                                that the same relation holds for both the domain-to-range and the
                                range-to-domain directions. An example of this is <hi rend="italic"
                                    >E53 Place. P122 borders with: E53 Place</hi>. The names of
                                symmetric properties have no parenthetical form, because reading in
                                the range-to-domain direction is the same as the domain-to-range
                                reading. Transitive asymmetric properties, such as <hi rend="italic"
                                    >E4 Period. </hi><hi rend="color(#000000)italic">P9 consist of
                                    (forms part of): E4 Period</hi>, have a parenthetical form that
                                relates to the meaning of the inverse direction.</item>
                            <item>The choice of the domain of properties, and hence the order of
                                their names, are established in accordance with the following

                        <p rend="justify">Because the CRM’s primary role is the meaningful
                            integration of information in an Open World, it aims to be monotonic in
                            the sense of Domain Theory. That is, the existing CRM constructs and the
                            deductions made from them must always remain valid and well-formed, even
                            as new constructs are added by extensions to the CRM.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">For example:</p>
                        <p rend="justify">One may add a subclass of E7 Activity to describe the
                            practice of an instance of group to use a certain name for a place over
                            a certain time-span. By this extension, no existing IsA Relationships or
                            property inheritances are compromised.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the CRM aims to enable the formal preservation of
                            monotonicity when augmenting a particular CRM compatible system. That
                            is, existing CRM instances, their properties and deductions made from
                            them, should always remain valid and well-formed, even as new instances,
                            regarded as consistent by the domain expert, are added to the
                            system.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">For example:</p>
                        <p rend="justify">If someone describes correctly that an item is an instance
                            of E19 Physical Object, and later it is correctly characterized as an
                            instance of E20 Biological Object, the system should not stop treating
                            it as an instance of E19 Physical Object. </p>
                        <p rend="justify">In order to formally preserve monotonicity for the
                            frequent cases of alternative opinions, all formally defined properties

                            so that conflicting instances of properties are merely accumulated. Thus
                            knowledge integrated following the CRM serves as a research base,
                            accumulating relevant alternative opinions around well-defined entities,
                            whereas conclusions about the truth are the task of open-ended
                            scientific or scholarly hypothesis building.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">For example:</p>

                            once they are entered into our knowledge base. Alternative opinions

                            should be accumulated without validity decisions being made during data

                            many times for a single item during its existence. Stating instances of
                            such properties for an item in terms of the CRM only means that these
                            properties existed during some  particular time-span. Therefore, one
                            item may have multiple instances of the same property reflecting an
                            aggregation of these instances over the time-span of its existence. If
                            more temporal details are required, the CRM recommends explicitly
                            describing the events of acquiring or losing such property instances,
                            such as by E9 Move etc. By virtue of this principle, the CRM achieves
                            monotonicity with respect to an increase of knowledge about the states
                            of an item at different times, regardless of their temporal order.
                            <lb/>  <lb/>However, for some of these properties many collection
                            databases describe the “current” state, such as “current location” or
                            “current owner”. Using such a “current” state means, that the database
                            manager is able to verify the respective reality at the latest date of
                            validity of the database. Obviously, this information is non-monotonic,
                            i.e., it requires deletion when the state changes. In order to preserve
                            a reduced monotonicity, these properties have time-neutral
                            superproperties by which respective instances can be reclassified if the
                            validity becomes unknown or no longer holds. Therefore the use of such
                            properties in the CRM is only recommended if they can be maintained
                            consistently. Otherwise, they should be reclassified by their
                            time-neutral superproperties. This holds in particular if data is
                            exported to another repository.</p>

                            begin with a unique object identifier and information about the "type"
                            of the object, often in a set of fields with names like

                            a particular category of items. In the CRM the class E55 Type comprises
                            such terms from thesauri and controlled vocabularies used to
                            characterize and classify instances of CRM classes. Instances of E55
                            Type represent concepts (universals) in contrast to instances of E41
                            Appellation which are used to name instances of CRM classes.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">E55 Type is the CRM’s interface to domain specific
                            ontologies and thesauri. These can be represented in the CRM as
                            subclasses of E55 Type, forming hierarchies of terms, i.e. instances of
                            E55 Type linked via P127 <hi rend="italic">has broader term (has
                                narrower term)</hi>. Such hierarchies may be extended with
                            additional properties.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">For this purpose the CRM provides two basic properties
                            that describe classification with terminology, corresponding to what is
                            the current practice in the majority of information systems. The class
                            E1 CRM Entity is the domain of the property P2 has type (is type of),
                            which has the range E55 Type. Consequently, every class in the CRM, with
                            the exception of E59 Primitive Value, inherits the property P2 has type
                            (is type of). This provides a general mechanism for simulating a
                            specialization of the classification of CRM instances to any level of
                            detail, by linking to external vocabulary sources, thesauri,
                            classification schema or ontologies.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Analogous to the function of the P2 has type (is type of)
                            property, some properties in the CRM are associated with an additional
                            property. These are numbered in the CRM documentation with a ‘.1’
                            extension. The range of these properties of properties always falls
                            under E55 Type. Their purpose is to simulate a specialization of their
                            parent property through the use of property subtypes declared as
                            instances of E55 Type. They do not appear in the property hierarchy list
                            but are included as part of the property declarations and referred to in
                            the class declarations. For example, P62.1 mode of depiction: E55 Type
                            is associated with E24 Physical Man-made Thing. P62 depicts (is depicted
                            by): E1 CRM Entity.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">The class E55 Type also serves as the range of properties
                            that relate to categorical knowledge commonly found in cultural
                            documentation. For example, the property <hi rend="italic">P125 used
                                object of type (was type of object used in) </hi>enables the CRM to
                            express statements such as “this casting was produced using a mould”,
                            meaning that there has been an unknown or unmentioned object, a mould,
                            that was actually used. This enables the specific instance of the
                            casting to be associated with the entire type of manufacturing devices
                            known as moulds. Further, the objects of type “mould” would be related
                            via <hi rend="italic">P2 has type (is type of)</hi> to this term. This
                            indirect relationship may actually help in detecting the unknown object
                            in an integrated environment. On the other side, some casting may refer
                            directly to a known mould via <hi rend="italic">P16 used specific object
                                (was used for)</hi>. So a statistical question to how many objects
                            in a certain collection are made with moulds could be answered correctly
                            (following both paths through <hi rend="italic">P16 used specific object
                                (was used for) - P2 has type (is type of)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >P125 used object of type (was type of object used in</hi>). This
                            consistent treatment of categorical knowledge enhances the CRM’s ability
                            to integrate cultural knowledge.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">In addition to being an interface to external thesauri and
                            classification systems E55 Type is an ordinary class in the CRM and a
                            subclass of E28 Conceptual Object. E55 Type and its subclasses inherit
                            all properties from this superclass. Thus together with the CRM class
                            E83 Type Creation the rigorous scholarly or scientific process that
                            ensures a type is exhaustively described and appropriately named can be
                            modelled inside the CRM. In some cases, particularly in archaeology and
                            the life sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an
                            exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an
                            appropriate scholarly forum. This is very central to research in the
                            life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a “taxon,” the type
                            description as a “protologue,” and the exemplary specimens as “original
                            element” or “holotype”.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Finally, types, that is, instances of E55 Type and its
                            subclasses, are used to characterize the instances of a CRM class and
                            hence refine the meaning of the class. A type ‘artist’ can be used to
                            characterize persons through <hi rend="italic">P2 has type (is type of).
                            </hi> On the other hand, in an art history application of the CRM it can
                            be adequate to extend the CRM class E21 Person with a subclass<hi
                                rend="italic">E21.xx </hi>Artist. What is the difference of the type
                            ‘artist’ and the class Artist? From an everyday conceptual point of view
                            there is no difference. Both denote the concept ‘artist’ and identify
                            the same set of persons. Thus in this setting a type could be seen as a
                            class and the class of types may be seen as a metaclass. Since current
                            systems do not provide an adequate control of user defined metaclasses,
                            the CRM prefers to model instances of E55 Type as if they were
                            particulars, with the relationships described in the previous
                            paragraphs.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Users may decide to implement a concept either as a
                            subclass extending the CRM class system or as an instance of E55 Type. A
                            new subclass should only be created in case the concept is sufficiently
                            stable and associated with additional explicitly modelled properties
                            specific to it. Otherwise, an instance of E55 Type provides more
                            flexibility of use. Users that may want to describe a discourse not only
                            using a concept extending the CRM but also describing the history of
                            this concept itself, may chose to model the same concept both as
                            subclass and as an instance of E55 Type with the same name. Similarly it
                            should be regarded as good practice to foresee for each term hierarchy
                            refining a CRM class a term equivalent of this class as top term. For
                            instance, a term hierarchy for instances of E21 Person may begin with
                            “Person”. </p>

                        <p>Since the intended scope of the CRM is a subset of the “real” world and
                            is therefore potentially infinite, the model has been designed to be
                            extensible through the linkage of compatible external type
                            hierarchies.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Compatibility of extensions with the CRM means that data
                            structured according to an extension must also remain valid as a CRM
                            instance. In practical terms, this implies <hi rend="italic">query
                                containment: </hi>any queries based on CRM concepts should retrieve
                            a result set that is correct according to the CRM’s semantics,
                            regardless of whether the knowledge base is structured according to the
                            CRM’s semantics alone, or according to the CRM plus compatible
                            extensions. For example, a query such as “list all events” should recall
                            100% of the instances deemed to be events by the CRM, regardless of how
                            they are classified by the extension.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">A sufficient condition for the compatibility of an
                            extension with the CRM is that CRM classes subsume all classes of the
                            extension, and all properties of the extension are either subsumed by
                            CRM properties, or are part of a path for which a CRM property is a
                            shortcut. Obviously, such a condition can only be tested
                            intellectually.</p>

                        <p>Of necessity, some concepts covered by the CRM are less thoroughly
                            elaborated than others: E39 Actor and E30 Right, for example. This is a
                            natural consequence of staying within the CRM’s clearly articulated
                            practical scope in an intrinsically unlimited domain of discourse. These

                <p rend="center italic">fig. 2 reasoning about spatial information</p>
                <p>The diagram above shows a partial view of the CRM, representing reasoning about
                    spatial information. Five of the main hierarchy branches are included in this
                    view: E39 Actor, E51 Contact Point, E41 Appellation, E53 Place and E70 Thing.
                    All classes are shown as blue-white rectangles. Properties are shown as single
                    arrows. In some cases the order of priority for property names has been reversed
                    in order to facilitate reading the diagram from left to right. Double arrows
                    indicate IsA relations between classes and their subclasses or between
                    properties and their subproperties. 'Shortcuts' are indicated with light grey
                    rectangles and their names are written in italics, such as the P59 has section
                    (is located on or within) between E53 Place and E18 Physical Thing, which is a
                    shortcut of the path through E46 Section Definition. .</p>
                <p rend="justify">As can be seen, an instance of E53 Place <hi rend="italic">is
                        identified by</hi> an instance of E44 Place Appellation, which may be an
                    instance of E45 Address, E47 Spatial Coordinates, E48 Place Name, or E46 Section
                    Definition such as ‘basement’, ‘prow’, or ‘lower left-hand corner.’ An instance
                    of E53 Place may <hi rend="italic">consist of </hi>or <hi rend="italic">form
                        part of</hi> another instance of E53 Place, thereby allowing a hierarchy of
                    geometric ‘containers’ to be constructed.</p>
                <p rend="justify">An instance of E45 Address can be considered both as an E44 Place
                    Appellation–a way of referring to an E53 Place–and as an E51 Contact Point for
                    an E39 Actor. An E39 Actor may have any number of instances of E51 Contact
                    Point. E18 Physical Thing is found on locations as a consequence of being
                    created there or being moved there. Therefore the properties <hi rend="italic"
                        >P53 has former or current location (is former or current location of)
                        (</hi>and <hi rend="italic">P55 has current location (currently holds)</hi>
                    are regarded as shortcuts of the fully articulated paths through the respective
                    events. <hi rend="italic">P55 has current location (currently holds)</hi> is a
                    subproperty of <hi rend="italic">P53</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">has former or current location (is former or current location
                        of)</hi>. The latter is a container for location information in the absence
                    of knowledge about time of validity and related events.</p>
                <p rend="justify">An interesting aspect of the model is the <hi rend="italic">P58
                        has section definition (defines section)</hi> property between E46 Section
                    Definition and E18 Physical Thing (and the corresponding shortcut from E53 Place
                    to E19 Physical Object). This allows an instance of E53 Place to be defined as a
                    section of an instance of E19 Physical Object. For example, we may know that
                    Nelson fell at a particular spot on the deck of H.M.S. Victory, without knowing
                    the exact position of the vessel in geospatial terms at the time of the fatal
                    shooting of Nelson. Similarly, a signature or inscription can be located “in the
                    lower right corner of” a painting, regardless of where the painting is
                    hanging.</p>

                <p rend="center italic">fig. 3 reasoning about temporal information</p>
                <p>This second example shows how the CRM handles reasoning about temporal
                    information. Four of the main hierarchy branches are included in this view: E2
                    Temporal Entity, E52 Time-Span, E77 Persistent Item and E53 Place.</p>
                <p rend="justify">The E2 Temporal Entity class is an abstract class (i.e. it has no
                    direct instances) that serves to group together all classes with a temporal
                    component, such as instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and E3 Condition State. </p>
                <p rend="justify">An instance of E52 Time-Span is simply a temporal interval that
                    does not make any reference to cultural or geographical contexts (unlike
                    instances of E4 Period, which <hi rend="italic">took place at </hi>a particular
                    instance of E53 Place). Instances of E52 Time-Span are sometimes identified by
                    instances of E49 Time Appellation, often in the form of E50 Date. </p>
                <p rend="justify">Both E52 Time-Span and E4 Period have transitive properties. E52
                    Time-Span has the transitive property<hi rend="italic"> P86 falls within
                        (contains), </hi>denoting a purely incidental inclusion; whereas E4 Period
                    has the transitive property<hi rend="italic"> P9 consists of (forms part of)
                    </hi>that supports the decomposition of instances of E4 Period into their
                    constituent parts. For example, the E52 Time-Span during which a building is
                    constructed might <hi rend="italic">falls within</hi> the E52 Time-Span of a
                    particular government, although there is no causal or contextual connection
                    between the two instances of E52 Time-Span; conversely, the E4 Period of the
                    Chinese Song Dynasty <hi rend="italic">consists of</hi> the Northern Song Period
                    and the Southern Song Period.</p>
                <p rend="justify">Instances of E52 Time-Span are related to their outer bounds (i.e.
                    their indeterminacy interval) by the property <hi rend="italic">P82 at some time

                        <p>Scope note: This class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of
                            E4 Periods, E5 Events and states, which happen over a limited extent in
                            time. This extent in time must be contiguous, i.e., without gaps. In
                            case the defining kinds of phenomena for an instance of E2 Temporal
                            Entity cease to happen, and occur later again at another time, we regard
                            that the former E2 Temporal Entity has ended and a new instance has come
                            into existence. In more intuitive terms, the same event cannot happen
                            twice.</p>
                        <p> In some contexts, these are also called perdurants. This class is
                            disjoint from E77 Persistent Item. This is an abstract class and has no
                            direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period,
                            which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or
                            lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to
                            instances of E18 Physical Thing.</p>

                        <p>An instance of this class describes the prevailing physical condition of

                            phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena
                            that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal bounds.
                            These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth,
                            spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and
                            coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the
                            same area as a sedentary culture. </p>
                        <p rend="justify">As the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we
                            regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during
                            their participation in an instance of E4 Period, the open spaces via
                            which they have interacted and the spaces by which they had the
                            potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by
                            the type of the respective period or event, such as the air in a meeting
                            room transferring the voices. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume
                            the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of
                            phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas. In these
                            cases, the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between
                            these areas are not regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent.
                            Consequently, instances of E4 Period may occupy each a limited number of
                            disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in
                            the total timespan covered by these spacetime volumes.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or
                            historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or
                            the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of
                            settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. Geopolitical
                            units may be distributed over disconnected areas, such as islands or
                            colonies. In such cases, the spatiotemporal extent is composed of more
                            than one spacetime volume. One may argue that the activities to govern
                            disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and
                            that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears
                            counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international
                            waters as extensions of geopolitical units. Nevertheless, an instance of
                            E4 Period must be contiguous in time. I.e., if it has ended in all
                            areas, it has ended as a whole, but it may involve one area after
                            another, such as the Polynesian migration, as long as it is ongoing at
                            least in one area.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">There are no assumptions about the scale of the associated
                            phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes
                            consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of
                            E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both
                            an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple
                            activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor. </p>
                        <p rend="justify">There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic
                            style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context.
                            For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from
                            approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular
                            characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among
                            others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can
                            be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the
                            characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters,
                            regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4
                            Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall
                            under E55 Type.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of
                            activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the
                            populated period of Nineveh.</p>

                        <p>Scope note: This class comprises changes of states in cultural, social or
                            physical systems, regardless of scale, brought about by a series or
                            group of coherent physical, cultural, technological or legal phenomena.
                            Such changes of state will affect instances of E77 Persistent Item or
                            its subclasses.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">The distinction between an E5 Event and an E4 Period is
                            partly a question of the scale of observation. Viewed at a coarse level
                            of detail, an E5 Event is an ‘instantaneous’ change of state. At a fine
                            level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within
                            a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period. The
                            reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give
                            rise to a noteworthy change of state.</p>

                        <p>Scope note: This class comprises events that destroy one or more
                            instances of E18 Physical Thing such that they lose their identity as
                            the subjects of documentation. </p>
                        <p>Some destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of
                            human activity. Intentional destruction may be documented by classifying
                            the event as both an E6 Destruction and E7 Activity. </p>
                        <p>The decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed or modified
                            is context sensitive: </p>
                        <p>1. If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the
                            event is modelled solely as E6 Destruction.</p>
                        <p>2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it
                            results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous
                            production of others using parts or material from the original. In this
                            case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but
                            identity is not.</p>
                        <p>3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical
                            Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as E11 Modification. </p>

                        <p>It specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision
                            as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive.
                            Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall
                            similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in
                            their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it
                            becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the

                        <p>Scope note: This class comprises the actions of making assertions about
                            properties of an object or any relation between two items or
                            concepts.</p>
                        <p>This class allows the documentation of how the respective assignment came
                            about, and whose opinion it was. All the attributes or properties
                            assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly attached to the
                            respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory
                            values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described
                            indirectly through an action are characterised as "short cuts" of this
                            action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred
                            because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the
                            action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can
                            be captured by simple rules. </p>
                        <p>In particular, the class describes the actions of people making
                            propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the
                            person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was
                            assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such
                            assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in
                            structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this
                            information should be accessible by structured queries. </p>

                        <p>Scope Note: This class comprises identifiable features that are
                            physically attached in an integral way to particular physical
                            objects.</p>
                        <p>Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of
                            instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or
                            three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders
                            that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier
                            objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being
                            attached by hinges, is not. </p>
                        <p>Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense,
                            such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in
                            an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider
                            sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary
                            borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the
                            surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble
                            statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to
                            state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be
                            separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object
                            may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature. </p>
                        <p>This definition coincides with the definition of "fiat objects" (Smith
                            &amp; Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of
                            “bona fide objects”. </p>

                            other human produced data that have become objects of a discourse about
                            their identity, circumstances of creation or historical implication. The
                            production of such information may have been supported by the use of
                            technical devices such as cameras or computers.</p>
                        <p>Characteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or
                            thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between
                            persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object have the ability to exist on
                            more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper,
                            electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human
                            memories, etc.</p>
                        <p>They cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at
                            least one carrier or in at least one human memory. Their existence ends
                            when the last carrier and the last memory are lost. </p>

                        <p>Instances of E29 Design or Procedure can be structured in parts and

                        <p>Designs or procedures can be seen as one of the following:</p>

                            publications. The size, orientation and colour may change, but the logo
                            remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are
                            reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of

                            of Galilean physics, having a beginning, an end and a duration.</p>
                        <p>Time Span has no other semantic connotations. Time-Spans are used to
                            define the temporal extent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any
                            other phenomena valid for a certain time. An E52 Time-Span may be
                            identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation. </p>
                        <p>Since our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span
                            can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of
                            temporal entities. The properties of E52 Time-Span are intended to allow
                            these approximations to be expressed precisely. An extreme case of
                            approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having
                            unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for
                            two events, it would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous,
                            even if nothing else was known.</p>
                        <p> Automatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is
                            facilitated if data can be parsed into an E61 Time Primitive.</p>

                        <p>Scope note: This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the
                            surface of the earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from
                            temporal phenomena and matter.</p>
                        <p>The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the
                            position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains,
                            rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by
                            combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this
                            frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place
                            Appellation.</p>
                        <p> It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified
                            by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative
                            references are often more relevant in the context of cultural
                            documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often
                            interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as
                            ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with
                            reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this
                            Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the
                            movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which
                            may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural
                            relevance.</p>
                        <p>Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination.
                            The model foresees the notion of a "section" of an E19 Physical Object
                            as a valid E53 Place determination.</p>

                        <p>Scope note: This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be
                            measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values,
                            i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as
                            natural or real numbers, RGB values etc.</p>
                        <p>An instance of E54 Dimension represents the true quantity, independent
                            from its numerical approximation, e.g. in inches or in cm. The
                            properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical
                            approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true
                            values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is
                            recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of
                            indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length
                            of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the
                            respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described
                            in different units depends critically on the representation as value
                            regions.</p>

                            used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents
                            corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional
                            instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.</p>

                            values such as integers, real numbers, complex numbers, vectors, tensors
                            etc., including intervals of these values to express limited

                        <p>Numbers are fundamentally distinct from identifiers in continua, such as
                            instances of E50 Date and E47 Spatial Coordinate, even though their
                            encoding may be similar. Instances of E60 Number can be combined with
                            each other in algebraic operations to yield other instances of E60
                            Number, e.g., 1+1=2. Identifiers in continua may be combined with
                            numbers expressing distances to yield new identifiers, e.g., 1924-01-31
                            + 2 days = 1924-02-02. Cf. E54 Dimension</p>

                            often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the
                            judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no
                            longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a
                            different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through
                            radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both
                            material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other
                            criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of
                            parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any
                            position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if
                            actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists.
                            There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not

                        <p rend="justify">Typical scenarios include the detachment of an accessory,
                            the removal of a component or part of a composite object, or the
                            deaccessioning of an object from a curated E78 Collection. If the E80
                            Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object
                            into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should
                            instead be modelled as an E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous
                            destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no
                            discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity
                            subsequent to its removal, the activity should be regarded as both E80
                            Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis
                            for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time,
                            of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious

                            Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from

                            different degrees of confidence in the truth of the asserted fact of
                            co-reference, because it may imply an interpretation of the (past)
                            knowledge behind the propositional objects assumed to be co-referring.
                            This degree of confidence, also known as “propositional attitude”, can
                            be described by using the property <hi rend="italic">P2 has type (is
                                type of)</hi>. In case different propositional attitudes should be
                            expressed per asserted propositional object, the assertion has
                            accordingly to be divided into one instance of E91 Co-Reference
                            Assignment for each propositional attitude.</p>
                        <p>This class aims mainly at the problem of interpreting in historical texts
                            to what particular entity a name, pronoun or equivalent kind of
                            expression was intended to refer to within a particular passage of the
                            text by its author. In other words, it expresses the uncertainty of the
                            creator of the assertion about the meaning of information provided by
                            another person. Such an interpretation can only be documented with
                            respect to another reference – either found in another text by the same
                            or another author, and/ or by referring to the world known to the
                            creator of the co-reference assertion himself. To do the latter, the
                            property <ref target="#_P155_has_co-reference">P155</ref>
                            <hi rend="italic">has co-reference target (is co-reference target
                                of)</hi> allows for referring to an instance of CRM Entity of the
                            creator’s world. In a sense, the respective instance of E91 Co-Reference
                            Assignment using the property <ref target="#_P155_has_co-reference"
                                >P155</ref>
                            <hi rend="italic">has co-reference target (is co-reference target
                                of)</hi> in a knowledge base forms propositional object referring to
                            the creator’s target entity, since a knowledge base as a whole can be
                            seen as a propositional object. Consequently, if in a Semantic Web
                            implementation the target entity is instantiated by a URI, the meaning
                            of this identifier must be unambiguous to the creator of the
                            co-reference assignment. Similarly, a URI of another authority, such as
                            an author catalogue of a library, can be interpreted as a referring
                            proposition of this catalogue, and be referred to by the property <ref
                                target="#_P153_assigned_co-reference"><hi rend="italic"
                                >P153</hi></ref><hi rend="italic">assigned co-reference to (was
                                regarded to co-refer by)</hi> or <ref target="#_P154_assigned_non"

                            to express that it does not immediately represent the creator’s known
                            world. In this case, the authority that knows the meaning of this URI
                            must be unambiguous by the form of the URI itself.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, the meaning of the property ‘owl:same_as’ of the OWL
                            knowledge representation language cannot specify who’s knowledge it
                            represents and cannot express propositional attitudes. Therefore it is
                            not adequate to model the progress of scholarly co-reference research
                            .</p>

                        <p rend="justify">The CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities
                            and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it
                            does not specialise entities any further than is required for this
                            immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CRM may
                            by specialised into any number of sub entities, which can be defined in
                            the E55 Type hierarchy. E51 Contact Point, for example, may be
                            specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office
                            box”, “URL” etc. none of which figures explicitly in the CRM hierarchy.
                            Sub typing obviously requires consistency between the meaning of the
                            terms assigned and the more general intent of the CRM entity in
                            question.</p>

                            regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good

                            respect to a reference space relative to which the thing is at rest. In
                            other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the
                            thing has covered at some time during its existence. In the case of an

                            feature is at rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature
                            and E53 Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance

                        <p>Scope note: This property associates an instance of E4 Period with the
                            real that is phenomenal, 4 dimensional point set or volume in spacetime
                            that it has occupied. The associated instance of E92 Spacetime Volume
                            includes the trajectories of the participating physical things during
                            their participation in the instance of E4 Period. This consists of the
                            open spaces via which they have interacted and the spaces by which they
                            had the potential to interact during that period or event.</p>
                        <p>Such interactions took place in the way defined by the type of the
                            respective period or event, such as the air in a meeting room
                            transferring the voices. Another example are the areas controlled by
                            some military power. In case of phenomena spreading out over islands or
                            other separated areas, the trajectories necessary for participants to
                            travel between these areas are not regarded as part of the occupied
                            spacetime volumes. Such instances of E4 Period occupy each a limited
                            number of contiguous spacetime volumes, however there must not be a
                            discontinuity in the total timespan covered by these spacetime volumes.
                            The real spacetime volumes occupied by an instance of E4 Period must not
                            be confused with declarations of spacetime approximating the real
                            extent. In general, instances of E4 Period have fuzzy boundaries in
                            spacetime. </p>
                        <p> Therefore it cannot be verified, if two different instances of E4 Period
                            occupy exactly the same spacetime volume. We therefore determine that a
                            spacetime volume may only be occupied by one instance of E4 Period.</p>

                <p rend="justify">The present version of the CIDOC CRM incorporates a series of
                    amendments to version 3.2.1, submitted to ISO and accepted as Committee Draft
                    ISO/CD 21127. These amendments were the result of a systematic exploration of
                    the requirements for the intended scope of the CIDOC CRM as decided in summer
                    2001. This includes in particular documentation in Natural History, archaeology
                    and the ability to communicate with traditional and Digital Libraries. These
                    amendments have been developed and approved by the CIDOC CRM Special Interest
                    Group, ISO/TC46/SC4/WG9 in a series of meetings together with various invited
                    experts in the period from July 2001 to October 2003. </p>
                <p rend="justify">With this version, the cycle of amendments to extend the
                    functionality of the CIDOC CRM ends. The development team felt that the task to
                    cover the intended scope as outlined in July 2001 and the general functionality
                    required by members of the team up to now has been successfully fulfilled.
                    Further amendments should only concern editorial changes to improve the clarity
                    of the text.  Therefore, the modelling constructs of the CIDOC CRM are expected
                    to undergo no changes from this version until the final International
                    Standard.</p>
                <p>With version 3.3.2, we have changed the format of the Definition of the CIDOC
                    CRM. We present:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>A general introduction to the model (as before)</item>
                    <item>The hierarchy of entities as an indented list (as before)</item>
                    <item>The hierarchy of properties as an indented list</item>
                    <item>The definition of each entity </item>
                    <item>The definition of each property.</item>
                </list>
                <p>We took out all cross-reference information, i.e. inherited properties, direct
                    and inherited inverse references of properties at the range entity, as well as
                    the indices to properties, alphabetically, by range and by domain. So this
                    document remains the pure definition, whereas the full cross-referenced text
                    will appear as an additional hypertext document, which will be
                    semi-automatically generated. The reason for this change are: (1) the size of
                    the cross-referenced document exceeds what one would normally print in one
                    document. (2) the cross-referencing does not contribute to the definition. (3)
                    Translators of the document are forced to manually trace the consistency of the
                    cross-referencing, a nearly impossible task. The cross-referenced document is of
                    course the only one, that allows for fully understanding the model by reading
                    and for using it in conceptual modelling.</p>
                <p>We further removed the references to the metamodel under which the CIDOC CRM was
                    initially developed. Even though the use of this metamodel has contributed a lot
                    to the rigidity of developing the CIDOC CRM, it seems to be of minor importance
                    for the use of the Model itself. Moreover it needs reworking, and metamodelling
                    is still not a standard procedure in conceptual modelling. Therefore the
                    development team decided not to make it a part of the standard to become.</p>
                <p>We present in the Annex the amendment history from version 3.2.1 on. This,
                    together with the meeting minutes and the “issues list” on the CIDOC CRM home
                    page, allows for tracing the correctness of this document with respect to the
                    decisions of the development team.</p>

                        is recommended to record all numerical approximations of instances of E54
                        Dimension as intervals of indeterminacy. Numerical approximations in archaic
                        instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be

                    <p>Scope note: This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured
                        by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or
                        regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real
                        numbers, RGB values etc.</p>
                    <p>An instance of E54 Dimension represents the true quantity, independent from
                        its numerical approximation, e.g. in inches or in cm. The properties of the
                        class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the
                        values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true values belong to a
                        non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record
                        them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing
                        the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as
                        4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note,
                        that interoperability of values described in different units depends
                        critically on the representation as value regions.</p>
                    <p>Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in
                        historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current
                        knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as
                        appropriate.</p>

                        <p rend="justify">Users intending to take advantage of the semantic
                            interoperability offered by the CRM may want to make parts of their data
                            structures compatible with the CRM. The respective parts should pertain
                            either to the associations by which users would like their data to be
                            accessible in an integrated environment, or to contents intended for
                            transport to other environments, so that the meaning encoded by its
                            structure is preserved in another target system. </p>
                        <p rend="justify">In that sense, the CRM is not aimed at proposing a
                            complete matching of user documentation structures with the CRM, nor
                            that a user should always implement all CRM concepts and associations;
                            rather it is intended to leave room for all kinds of extensions to
                            capture the richness of cultural information, but also for
                            simplifications for reasons of economy. </p>
                        <p rend="justify">Further, the CRM is a means to interpret structured
                            information in a way, so that large amounts of data contents can be
                            transformed or mediated automatically. As a consequence, the CRM aims
                            not at resolving free text information into a formal logical form. In
                            other terms, it does not intend to provide more structuring than the
                            users have done before, and free text information does not fall under
                            the scope of compatibility considerations. The CRM foresees however the
                            associations to transport such information in relation to structured
                            information. </p>
                        <p rend="justify">The CRM is a formal ontology, expressible in terms of
                            logic or a suitable knowledge representation language. Its concepts can
                            be instantiated as sets of statements that form models of the assumed
                            reality referred to in a structured document. Any encoding of CRM
                            instances in a formal language that preserves the relations to the CRM
                            classes, properties and inheritance rules among them is regarded a
                            “CRM-compatible form”.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">A part of a documentation structure is compatible with the
                            CRM, if a deterministic logical algorithm can be found, that transforms

                            without loss of meaning. No assumptions are made about the nature of
                            this algorithm. It may in particular draw on other formal ontologies
                            expressing background knowledge such as thesauri. The algorithm itself
                            can only be found and verified intellectually by understanding the
                            meaning intended by the designer of the data structure and the CRM
                            concepts. By the term “correctly encoded” we mean that the data are
                            encoded so that the meaning intended by the designer of the data
                            structure is correctly applied to the intended meaning of the data. </p>

                            It is not regarded a loss of compatibility, if certain subclasses and

                            case it is regarded essential that the services publishes the set of CRM

                        <p> The goal of the CRM is to enable the integration of the largest number
                            of information resources. Therefore it aims to provide the greatest
                            flexibility of systems to become compatible, rather than imposing one
                            particular solution.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Users intending to take advantage of the semantic
                            interoperability offered by the CRM may want to make parts of their data
                            structures compatible with the CRM. Compatibility may pertain either to
                            the associations by which users would like their data to be accessible
                            in an integrated environment, or to the contents intended for transport
                            to other environments, allowing encoded meaning to be preserved in a
                            target system.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">The CRM does not require complete matching of all user
                            documentation structures with the CRM, nor that systems should always
                            implement all CRM concepts and associations; instead it leaves room both
                            for extensions, needed to capture the full richness of cultural
                            information, and for simplifications, required for reasons of
                            economy.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Furthermore, the CRM provides a means of interpreting
                            structured information so that large amounts of data can be transformed
                            or mediated automatically. It does not require unstructured or
                            semi-structured free text information to be analysed into a formal
                            logical representation. In other words, it does not aim to provide more
                            structure than users have previously provided. The interpretation of
                            information in the form of free text falls outside the scope of
                            compatibility considerations. The CRM does, however, allow free text
                            information to be integrated with structured information.</p>

                        <p rend="justify">In the context of this chapter, the expression “without
                            loss of meaning with respect to the CRM concepts” means the following:
                            The CRM concepts are used to classify items of discourse and their
                            relationships. By virtue of this classification, data can be understood
                            as propositions of a kind declared by the CRM about real world facts,
                            such as “Object x. forms part of: Object y”. In case the encoding, i.e.
                            the language used to describe a fact, is changed, only an expert
                            conversant with both languages can assess if the two propositions do
                            indeed describe the same fact. If this is the case, then there is no
                            loss of meaning with respect to CRM concepts. Communities of practice
                            requiring fewer concepts than the CRM declares may restrict CRM
                            compatibility with respect to an explicitly declared subset of the
                            CRM.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Users of this standard may communicate CRM compatible
                            data, as detailed below, with data structures and systems that are
                            either more detailed and specialized than the CRM or whose scope extends
                            beyond that of the CRM. In such cases, the standard guarantees only the
                            preservation of meaning with respect to CRM concepts. However,
                            additional information that can be regarded as extending CRM concepts
                            may be communicated and preserved in CRM compatible systems through the
                            appropriate use of controlled terminology. The specification of the
                            latter techniques does not fall under the scope of this standard.
                            Communities of practice requiring extensions to the CRM are encouraged
                            to declare their extensions as CRM-compatible standards.</p>

                        <p rend="justify">The CRM is a formal ontology which can be expressed in
                            terms of logic or a suitable knowledge representation language. Its
                            concepts can be instantiated as sets of statements that provide a model
                            of reality. We call any encoding of such CRM instances in a formal
                            language that preserves the relations between the CRM <hi rend="italic"

                            data expressed in any CRM-compatible form can be automatically
                            transformed into any other CRM-compatible form without loss of meaning.
                            Classes and properties of the CRM are identified by their initial codes,
                            such as “E55” or “P12”. The names of classes and properties of a

                            “Object Name,” “Category,” “Classification,” etc. All these fields are

                            that relate to categorical knowledge commonly found in cultural
                            documentation. For example, the property <hi rend="italic">P125 used
                                object of type (was type of object used in) </hi>enables the CRM to
                            express statements such as “this casting was produced using a mould”,
                            meaning that there has been an unknown or unmentioned instance of
                            “mould” that was actually used. This enables the specific instance of
                            the casting to be associated with the entire type of manufacturing
                            devices known as moulds. Further, the objects of type “mould” would be
                            related via <hi rend="italic">P2 has type (is type of)</hi> to this
                            term. This indirect relationship may actually help in detecting the
                            unknown object in an integrated environment. On the other side, some
                            casting may refer directly to a known mould via <hi rend="italic">P16
                                used specific object (was used for)</hi>. So a statistical question
                            to how many objects in a certain collection are made with moulds could
                            be answered correctly (following both paths through<hi rend="italic">P16
                                used specific object (was used for) - P2 has type (is type of)</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">P125 used object of type (was type of object used
                                in</hi>). This consistent treatment of categorical knowledge
                            significantly enhances the CRM’s ability to integrate cultural
                            knowledge.</p>

                            are included as part of the property declarations and referred to in the
                            class declarations. For example, <hi rend="italic">P62.1 mode of

                            to that of the <hi rend="italic">P2 has type (is type of)</hi> property,
                            which all CRM classes inherit from E1 CRM Entity. System implementations
                            and schemas that do not support properties of properties may use dynamic
                            subtyping of the parent properties instead.</p>
                        <p>Finally, types play a central role in the history of human understanding;
                            they are intellectual products, and documentation about the history and
                            justification by physical evidence of types (particularly in disciplines
                            such as archaeology and natural history) falls squarely within the
                            intended scope of the CRM. Therefore types are modelled as “conceptual
                            objects,” in parallel to their structural role as metaclasses. This
                            approach elegantly addresses the dual nature of types in a manner
                            consistent with material culture and natural history documentation.</p>

                        <p rend="justify">Virtually all structured descriptions of museum objects
                            begin with a unique object identifier and information about the "type"
                            of the object, often in a set of fields with names like
                            "Classification", "Category", "Object Type", "Object Name", etc. All
                            these fields are used for terms that declare that the object belongs to
                            a particular category of items. In the CRM the class E55 Type comprises
                            such terms from thesauri and controlled vocabularies used to
                            characterize and classify instances of CRM classes. Instances of E55
                            Type represent concepts (universals) in contrast to instances of E41
                            Appellation which are used to name instances of CRM classes.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">E55 Type is the CRM’s interface to domain specific
                            ontologies and thesauri. These can be represented in the CRM as
                            subclasses of E55 Type, forming hierarchies of terms, i.e. instances of
                            E55 Type linked via P127 has broader term (has narrower term). Such
                            hierarchies may be extended with additional properties. </p>
                        <p rend="justify">For this purpose the CRM provides two basic properties
                            that describe classification with terminology, corresponding to what is
                            the current practice in the majority of information systems. The class
                            E1 CRM Entity is the domain of the property P2 has type (is type of),
                            which has the range E55 Type. Consequently, every class in the CRM, with
                            the exception of E59 Primitive Value, inherits the property P2 has type
                            (is type of). This provides a general mechanism for simulating a
                            specialization of the classification of CRM instances to any level of
                            detail, by linking to external vocabulary sources, thesauri,
                            classification schema or ontologies.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Analogous to the function of the P2 has type (is type of)
                            property, some properties in the CRM are associated with an additional
                            property. These are numbered in the CRM documentation with a ‘.1’
                            extension. The range of these properties of properties always falls
                            under E55 Type. Their purpose is to simulate a specialization of their
                            parent property through the use of property subtypes declared as
                            instances of E55 Type. They do not appear in the property hierarchy list
                            but are included as part of the property declarations and referred to in
                            the class declarations. For example, P62.1 mode of depiction: E55 Type
                            is associated with E24 Physical Man-made Thing. P62 depicts (is depicted
                            by): E1 CRM Entity.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">The class E55 Type also serves as the range of properties
                            that relate to categorical knowledge commonly found in cultural
                            documentation. For example, the property P125 used object of type (was
                            type of object used in) enables the CRM to express statements such as
                            “this casting was produced using a mould”, meaning that there has been
                            an unknown or unmentioned object, a mould, that was actually used. This
                            enables the specific instance of the casting to be associated with the
                            entire type of manufacturing devices known as moulds. Further, the
                            objects of type “mould” would be related via P2 has type (is type of) to
                            this term. This indirect relationship may actually help in detecting the
                            unknown object in an integrated environment. On the other side, some
                            casting may refer directly to a known mould via P16 used specific object
                            (was used for). So a statistical question to how many objects in a
                            certain collection are made with moulds could be answered correctly
                            (following both paths through P16 used specific object (was used for) -
                            P2 has type (is type of) and P125 used object of type (was type of
                            object used in). This consistent treatment of categorical knowledge
                            enhances the CRM’s ability to integrate cultural knowledge.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">In addition to being an interface to external thesauri and
                            classification systems E55 Type is an ordinary class in the CRM and a
                            subclass of E28 Conceptual Object. E55 Type and its subclasses inherit
                            all properties from this superclass. Thus together with the CRM class
                            E83 Type Creation the rigorous scholarly or scientific process that
                            ensures a type is exhaustively described and appropriately named can be
                            modelled inside the CRM. In some cases, particularly in archaeology and
                            the life sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an
                            exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an
                            appropriate scholarly forum. This is very central to research in the
                            life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a “taxon,” the type
                            description as a “protologue,” and the exemplary specimens as “original
                            element” or “holotype”.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Finally, types, that is, instances of E55 Type and its
                            subclasses, are used to characterize the instances of a CRM class and
                            hence refine the meaning of the class. A type ‘artist’ can be used to
                            characterize persons through P2 has type (is type of). On the other
                            hand, in an art history application of the CRM it can be adequate to
                            extend the CRM class E21 Person with a subclass E21.xx Artist. What is
                            the difference of the type ‘artist’ and the class Artist? From an
                            everyday conceptual point of view there is no difference. Both denote
                            the concept ‘artist’ and identify the same set of persons. Thus in this
                            setting a type could be seen as a class and the class of types may be
                            seen as a metaclass. Since current systems do not provide an adequate
                            control of user defined metaclasses, the CRM prefers to model instances
                            of E55 Type as if they were particulars, with the relationships
                            described in the previous paragraphs.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Users may decide to implement a concept either as a
                            subclass extending the CRM class system or as an instance of E55 Type. A
                            new subclass should only be created in case the concept is sufficiently
                            stable and associated with additional explicitly modeled properties
                            specific to it. Otherwise, an instance of E55 Type provides more
                            flexibility of use. Users that may want to describe a discourse not only
                            using a concept extending the CRM but also describing the history of
                            this concept itself, may chose to model the same concept both as
                            subclass and as an instance of E55 Type with the same name. Similarly it
                            should be regarded as good practice to foresee for each term hierarchy
                            refining a CRM class a term equivalent of this class as top term. For
                            instance, a term hierarchy for instances of E21 Person may begin with
                            “Person”. </p>

                        <p>To:</p>
                        <p>It intends to provide a model of the intellectual structure of cultural
                            documentation in logical terms. As such, it is not optimised for
                            implementation-specific storage and processing aspects. Implementations
                            may lead to solutions where elements and links between relevant elements
                            of our conceptualizations are no longer explicit in a database or other
                            structured storage system. For instance the birth event that connects
                            elements such as father, mother, birth date, birth place may not appear
                            in the database, in order to save storage space or response time of the
                            system. The CRM allows us to explain how such apparently disparate
                            entities are intellectually interconnected, and how the ability of the
                            database to answer certain intellectual questions is affected by the
                            omission of such elements and links.</p>

                            meeting, at 19 November – 22 November, 2012, at Amersfoort, Netherlands,
                            the CRM-SIG, resolving the ISSUE 204, decided to add the following text
                            in the monotonicity section in page xvi.</p>
                        <p>The following text is added: </p>
                        <p>Properties, such as having a part, an owner or a location, may change
                            many times for a single item during its existence. Stating instances of
                            such properties for an item in terms of the CRM only means that these
                            properties existed during some particular time-span. Therefore, one item
                            may have multiple instances of the same property reflecting an
                            aggregation of these instances over the time-span of its existence. If
                            more temporal details are required, the CRM recommends explicitly
                            describing the events of acquiring or losing such property instances,
                            such as by E9 Move etc. By virtue of this principle, the CRM achieves
                            monotonicity with respect to an increase of knowledge about the states
                            of an item at different times, regardless of their temporal order. </p>
                        <p>However, for some of these properties many collection databases describe
                            the “current” state, such as “current location” or “current owner”.
                            Using such a “current” state means, that the database manager is able to
                            verify the respective reality at the latest date of validity of the
                            database. Obviously, this information is non-monotonic, i.e., it
                            requires deletion when the state changes. In order to preserve a reduced
                            monotonicity, these properties have time-neutral superproperties by
                            which respective instances can be reclassified if the validity becomes
                            unknown or no longer holds. Therefore the use of such properties in the
                            CRM is only recommended if they can be maintained consistently.
                            Otherwise, they should be reclassified by their time-neutral
                            superproperties. This holds in particular if data is exported to another
                            repository.</p>

                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Instantiation is the term that describes the case that
                                an instance of class A is also regarded as an instance of one or
                                more other classes B1...n at the same time. When multiple
                                instantiation is used, it has the effect that the properties of all
                                these classes become available to describe this instance. For
                                instance, some particular cases of destruction may also be
                                activities(e.g.,Herostratos’ deed), but not all destructions are
                                activities (e.g., destruction of Herculaneum). In comparison,
                                multiple inheritance describes the case that all instances of a
                                class A are implicitly instances of all superclasses of A, by virtue
                                of the definition of the class A, whereas the combination of classes
                                used for multiple instantiation is a characteristic of particular
                                instances only. It is important to note that multiple instantiation
                                is not allowed using combinations of disjoint classes</hi>.”</p>

                                lifetime with respect to a reference space relative to which the
                                thing is at rest. In other words, it is the volume that contains all

                                existence. In the case of an E26 Physical Feature the default
                                reference space is the one in which the object that bears the
                                feature or at least the surrounding matter of the feature is at
                                rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature and E53
                                Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance (E26

                            inverse of another, but an interpretation implicitly existing for any
                            property. The inverse of the inverse of a property is identical to the

                                interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to

                            the potential to interact during that period or event. Such interactions
                            took place in the way defined by the type of the respective period or
                            event, such as the air in a meeting room transferring the voices.
                            Another example are the areas controlled by some military power. In case
                            of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, the
                            trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas
                            are not regarded as part of the occupied spacetime volumes. Such
                            instances of E4 Period occupy each a limited number of contiguous
                            spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the
                            total timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. The real spacetime
                            volumes occupied by an instance of E4 Period must not be confused with
                            declarations of spacetime approximating the real extent. In general,
                            instances of E4 Period have fuzzy boundaries in spacetime. </p>
                        <p rend="background-color(#ffff00)"> Therefore it cannot be verified, if two
                            different instances of E4 Period occupy exactly the same spacetime
                            volume. We therefore determine that a spacetime volume may only be
                            occupied by one instance of E4 Period.</p>
