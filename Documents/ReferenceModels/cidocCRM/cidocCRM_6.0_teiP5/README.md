FactMiners - #cidocCRM 6.x Word-2-TEIP5
==========

My challenges in decyphering the full text of this reference document were enough to put me on a different path when the CIDOC SIG published the 6.0 release of the model. Rather than continually tweak the parsing scripts regexes and assumptions about overall document structure, it occured to me that the #cidocCRM would benefit from being converted to a TEI P5 document!

With a P5 version of the #cidocCRM Definition document, metamodelers and developers would be able to immediately jump to importing or referencing directly the official edition of the CIDOC CRM Definition.
